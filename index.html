		<p>Hi, I'm Christine. I am a marketer turned UX Designer. I have a degree in psychology and a passion for strategy. My interest in user experience design stems from my interest in understanding what motivates people to think, feel, and behave the way that they do. I believe that businesses that get inside their users' heads can anticipate user needs and bring innovative products and services to market more effectively and more efficiently. Where business goals meet user goals is an intersection that fascinates me and is exactly where I want to work.</p>
